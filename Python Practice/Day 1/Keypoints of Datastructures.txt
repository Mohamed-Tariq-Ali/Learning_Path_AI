Keypoints:

*List items are ordered , changeable and allows duplicate values. enclosed with square braces [].
*To determine how many elements the list has , we use len() function.
*List items can be of any datatype , it can different types of data.
*From Python's perspective, lists are defined as objects with the data type 'list':
*type() function is used to identify whats the datatype of the list.
*list()-constructor is used when creating a new list.
*we can do CRUD operations on the list.
*append() method to add items in the list
*insert() method used to add items in the specified index.
*extend() method is used to combine two lists.
*The extend() method does not have to append lists, you can add any iterable object (tuples, sets, dictionaries etc.).
* clear() method is used to empty the list.
* del method is used to delete the specified list element and also the entire lists.

DOUBTS : While accessing elements during negative indexing , cant we get elements like [-1:] ?
* while using extend() keyword , the extended list gets stored in the first list , example my_list.extend(list1) #stores the value in my_list. List1 remains the same.
* Why am i getting None , when i try to print the sort function for the list , #print(list.sort()) ?
* NEED SOME CLARIFICATION WITH LIST COMPREHENSION .

DICTIONARY :
*Dictionaries are used to store key value pairs in data.
* A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.
* Enclosed with curly braces.
*Updating and inserting the values in dictionary works the same way


DOUBTS :
dict1 = dict("Name" : "Tariq" , "Age" : 21 , "Location":"Chennai")  Why does this line is giving an error ?
NEED CLARITY WITH DICT COMPREHENSION.

SET:
* Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
*A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.
* Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.
*Set items consider True and 1 as same and False and 0 as same and it doesn't allow it . Set doesn't allow duplicate values.
*Enclosed with curly braces {}.
*We cannot change the values in the set once its created.
*add() method is used to add single  element to the set.
*update() method is used to add multiple elements.
*remove() method is used to remove the element, if the element is not present it will raise an error
*discard() method is used to remove the element, if the element is not present it will raise NOT an error.
*clear() method is used to clear all the elements in the set.

SET OPERATIONS:'
The union() and update() methods joins all items from both sets.

The intersection() method keeps ONLY the duplicates.

The difference() method keeps the items from the first set that are not in the other set(s).

The symmetric_difference() method keeps all items EXCEPT the duplicates. we can also use ^ instead .

* we can use | operator instead of union() method , it will give the same results.

FROZEN SET:
frozenset is an immutable version of a set.

Like sets, it contains unique, unordered, unchangeable elements.

Unlike sets, elements cannot be added or removed from a frozenset.

==============END OF SET========================================================

TUPLES :
*Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.
*Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
*Enclosed with round brackets ().
*It allows duplicate values.
*To create a tuple with only one item, you have to add a comma after the item, otherwise Python will not recognize it as a tuple. tuple1 =("hi",)
